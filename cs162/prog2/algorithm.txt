Program 2

This program is a simple puzzle game that has two players and can go no longer
than 5 rounds. The game starts with player 1 entering a word and then a phrase,
the word is then imbedded into the passed phrase with the following rules:
  1. Each word gets one character embedded into it, the nth word gets the nth
     character, ie. the second character goes in the second words second
     character, and so on.
  2. If a word in the player entered phrase is all capitalized we skip the word
     not embedding any characters into that word.
  3. If a word is not long enough to embed the current character the word gets
     skipped and has no character stored in it.
  4. If a word has a dollar sign infront of it and is long enough, it will have
     two characters embedded.
